# Introduction 
enterance exam project for getting hired in a game company. I had some tasks inside the test and the result was this project.

# Getting Started
just open it with unity 3d. you'll figure it out

# Build and Test
you can run the game using unity editor or build it for pc platform on unity
how to play: use left click to shoot red bullets and right-click to shoot blue bullets. each bullet is
effective on the enemies with the same color. you can see how much time is left until the
next wave of enemies spawn. the more enemies on the screen the faster ur energy will drain.
if you don't lose shots you'll get a combo which adds to the score that you get. 
if your energy finishes game ends.
