# Small Tank Game
![Screenshot](screenshot.jpg?raw=true)
## Introduction 
Enterance exam project for getting hired in a game development company. I had some tasks inside the test and the result was this project.


## Getting Started
Just open it with Unity3D and you will figure out the rest.


### Build and Test
The game can be played directly inside the editor or using the standalone version.


## How to play
### Rules

![How](howto.jpg?raw=true)

Destroy enemies with the bullets of the same color, defeat the waves of coming enemies as indicated in the bottom left of the screen and score as high as you can.

With more enemies present, the faster the energy bar will drain. Not missing shots increases the combo and effectively the score. The game ends when all of the energy is drained.

### Buttons

- Rotate (Mouse / Left stick)

- Red bullet (LMB / A / ✕)

- Blue bullet (RMB / B / ◯)

- Reset (R / RB / R1)

- Exit (ESC / Back / Share)
